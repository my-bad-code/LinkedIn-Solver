This is a Chrome browser extension that uses GPT4 to solve pretty much all LinkedIn qualification tests. 

Only thing that doesn't work is if the question is in relation to a picture. 

How to use?

1. Download the folder.
2. Unzip.
3. Add your OpenAI API key in line 9 of content.js and save the file.
4. Add to Chrome.
5. Open LinkedIn and start any quiz to the point of the first question being displayed.
6. Hit "#" and lean back while the extension goes through all questions. 

(Note: Only hit "#" once, it automatically solves all questions.) 
(Note2: This requires access to the GPT4 model.)
